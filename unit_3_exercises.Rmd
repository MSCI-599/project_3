### In-class exercises
### Unit 3: Penguins

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

***

### Exercise 1.1

Build a data set that contains only Chinstrap penguins. Then build another data set that contains only Chinstrap penguins with a flipper length > 200 mm. What is the sex ratio of Chinstrap penguins? How does that compare to the sex ratio of Chinstrap penguins with a flipper length > 200 mm? Use the `summary()` function to examine sex ratios. Given this analysis, what do you think the relationship is between sex and flipper length?

```{r}
# Sex ratio of all Chinstrap observations
chin = penguins %>% filter(species=="Chinstrap")
summary(chin)
sex_ratio_all = 34/68

# Sex ratio of Chinstrap penguins with flipper length > 200 mm
chin_long_wing_ladies = penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Chinstrap",
         flipper_length_mm > 200)
summary(chin_long_wing_ladies)
sex_ratio_subset = 1/18
```

***

### Exercise 1.2

Repeat Exercise 1.1, but this time use `group_by()` along with the `n()` function inside `summarize()` to count the number of Chinstrap penguins of each sex. Again compare the sex ratio of all Chinstrap observations vs. the sex ratio of Chinstrap penguins with a flipper length > 200 mm.

```{r}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Chinstrap") %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(n=n())


penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Chinstrap",
         flipper_length_mm > 200) %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(n=n())
```

***

### Exercise 1.3

What is the mean bill length (in inches) of Adelie penguins found on either Dream island or Biscoe island? What is the standard deviation? Is the mean larger or smaller than the mean bill length of Adelie penguins found on Torgersen island?

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species=="Adelie",
         island %in% c("Biscoe","Dream")) %>%
  mutate(bill_length_in = bill_length_mm * 0.039) %>% # Conversion: 0.0393701 inches / mm
  summarize(mean_bill_length_in = mean(bill_length_in), 
            sd_bill_length_in = sd(bill_length_in))

penguins %>% 
  filter(species=="Adelie",
         island =="Torgersen",
         !is.na(bill_length_mm)) %>%
  mutate(bill_length_in = bill_length_mm * 0.039) %>% # Conversion: 0.0393701 inches / mm
  summarize(mean_bill_length_in = mean(bill_length_in), 
            sd_bill_length_in = sd(bill_length_in))
```

***

### Exercise 2.1

Build a scatter plot of bill depth vs. bill length for Adelie penguins. Map the point colors to the island that the Adelie penguin was observed on. Add axes labels and a main title. 

```{r}
adelie = penguins %>%
  filter(species=="Adelie")
ggplot(data = adelie) + 
  geom_point(aes(y=bill_depth_mm, x=bill_length_mm, color=island)) + 
  xlab("Bill length (mm)") +
  ylab("Bill Depth (mm)") +
  ggtitle("Adelie bills")
```

***

### Exercise 2.2

Build another scatter plot of bill depth vs. bill length for all three penguin species. Map the point colors to the penguin's sex. Use `facet_wrap()` to plot each species in a separate panel. Look at the documentation for `facet_wrap()` and play around with the `scales` parameter. What is the default value? Try plotting with the parameter `scales="free"`. Instead of using the default theme, choose a different pre-packaged theme (I like `theme_bw()` and `theme_classic()`). Save the plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins) + 
  geom_point(aes(y=bill_depth_mm, x=bill_length_mm, color=sex)) + 
  facet_wrap(~species, scales="free") + 
  theme_classic() +
  ggsave(filename = "figures/bill_depth_v_length.png", device = "png", width = 6, height = 3.5, units = "in", dpi = 300)
```

***

### Exercise 3.1

Are Adelie penguin flipper lengths significantly different between males and females? Do some exploratory data analysis. Compute summary statistics and plot histograms. Then conduct an independent sample t-test. What do your results show?

```{r}
library(rstatix) # t_test()

# Simplify the dataset to what we need
ex_1_data = penguins %>%
  filter(species =="Adelie",
         !is.na(flipper_length_mm),
         !is.na(sex)) %>%   # students may forget to do this
  dplyr::select(sex, flipper_length_mm) %>%
  droplevels() # removes empty levels from factors

summary(ex_1_data)

# Calculate summary stats
ex_1_data %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(mean=mean(flipper_length_mm), sd=sd(flipper_length_mm))

# Plot a quick histogram:
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x=flipper_length_mm), data=ex_1_data) +
  facet_wrap(~sex)

# Base R:
t.test(ex_1_data$flipper_length_mm ~ ex_1_data$sex)
# rstatix:
ex_1_data %>% 
  t_test(flipper_length_mm ~ sex)
# Flipper length is significantly different between the 2 sexes
```

***

### Exercise 4.1

Calculate the correlation between bill length and bill depth with all 3 penguin species combined into a single data set. Is the correlation stronger or weaker compared to the correlation between bill length and bill depth for Gentoo penguins alone? Do you notice anything unexpected about this correlation?

```{r}
# Check normality assumption with a qqplot:
ggplot(penguins) +
  stat_qq(aes(sample=bill_length_mm))
ggplot(penguins) +
  stat_qq(aes(sample=bill_depth_mm))

cor.test(x=penguins$bill_length_mm, y=penguins$bill_depth_mm, use="complete.obs")
# Correlation is much weaker with all penguins combined than with Gentoo alone
# Correlation with all penguins combined is NEGATIVE - why would bill length get bigger as bill depth gets smaller?
```

***

### Exercise 5.1

Build a model predicting Gentoo bill depth as a function of flipper length. Plot the predictions. Which explanatory variable (bill length vs. flipper length) does a better job of predicting bill depth? What is your evidence?

```{r}
gentoo = penguins %>% filter(species=="Gentoo")

lm_bill_length = lm(bill_depth_mm ~ bill_length_mm, data=gentoo)
summary(lm_bill_length)

lm_flip = lm(bill_depth_mm ~ flipper_length_mm, data=gentoo)
summary(lm_flip)

ggplot(data=gentoo, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
     geom_point() +
     geom_smooth(method = "lm")
AIC(lm_flip, lm_bill_length)
```

The Adjusted $R^2$ is higher in the flipper model than in the bill length model, so flipper length does a better job of predicting bill depth for Gentoo penguins. You can also compare the Akaike Information Criteria of the two models with `AIC()`, and the model with the smaller AIC is a better fit. Differences of >2 AIC units are considered statistically significant.

***

### Exercise 5.2

Build a multiple linear regression model where penguin `bill_depth_mm` is a function of `flipper_length_mm` + `species`. Use `ggPredict()` to plot the data and the model predictions. 

```{r}
lm_flip = lm(bill_depth_mm ~ flipper_length_mm + species, data=penguins)
summary(lm_flip) # Adj-R^2 = 0.7537
ggPredict(lm_flip, se=TRUE, interactive=TRUE)

summary(lm_3) # Adj-R^2 = 0.7669 
# flipper_length_mm + species is a better fit than bill_length_mm + species
```

***

### Exercise 5.3

Plot the model predictions from our model `lm_gentoo_3` so that we can see the variation in bill depth vs. flipper length while holding bill length and body mass constant at their medians.

```{r}
gentoo = penguins %>% filter(species=="Gentoo")
lm_gentoo_3 = lm(bill_depth_mm ~ bill_length_mm + flipper_length_mm + body_mass_g, data=gentoo)

### Look at bill depth ~ flipper length while holding bill length and body mass constant
# Use expand to get full range of 1 variable, then add in median of other variable(s) from original data
newdata = gentoo %>% 
  expand(flipper_length_mm) %>% # Full range of data (gets rid of other variables)
  mutate(bill_length_mm = median(gentoo$bill_length_mm, na.rm=TRUE), 
         body_mass_g = median(gentoo$body_mass_g, na.rm=TRUE))

lm_gentoo_3_predict = lm_gentoo_3 %>%
  augment(newdat = newdata, se_fit=TRUE) %>%
  mutate(lwr = .fitted - 1.96 * .se.fit, upr = .fitted + 1.96 * .se.fit) # Calculate 95% C.I. using SE
# Plot the data and the model predictions
ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm), data=gentoo) + # original data
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr, x = flipper_length_mm), alpha = .15, data=lm_gentoo_3_predict) +
  geom_line(data=lm_gentoo_3_predict, aes(y = .fitted, x = flipper_length_mm), size = 1)
```

***

### Exercise 5.4

Conduct an Analysis of Variance to determine whether Adelie body mass is significantly different between the three islands where observations were collected. Conduct a post-hoc Tukey test if appropriate.

```{r}
adelie_anova = aov(body_mass_g ~ island + sex, data=penguins %>% filter(species=="Adelie"))
summary(adelie_anova)
TukeyHSD(adelie_anova)  # Illogical analysis since ANOVA shows no difference btwn island
```
